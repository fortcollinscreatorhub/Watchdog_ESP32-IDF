# Watchdog_ESP32-IDF
This code is written for a "CurrentReader" board

It controls a relay by processing MQTT requests and button presses.
It monitors current used by the device controlled by the relay and enforces 
duty cycle and max-time constraints.

See the [User Manual](docs/user-manual.md) for documentation.

# Development

See the [developer guide](docs/README-dev.md) for information re: how to build the software.
